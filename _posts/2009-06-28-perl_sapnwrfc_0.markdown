<h3>Perl sapnwrfc 0.30</h3>

<p>I doing some work for a client recently, I got the opportunity to do some major performance work on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/sapnwrfc/">sapnwrfc</a> for Perl.  The net result is that a number of memory leaks, mainly of Perl values not going out of scope properly, have been fixed.</p>

<p>Additionally, I've had some time to put together a proper cookbook style set of examples in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/sapnwrfc/sapnwrfc-cookbook.pod">sapnwrfc-cookbook</a>.  These examples, while specifically for Perl, are almost identical for sapnwrfc for <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/sapnwrfc/">Python</a>, <a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sapnwrfc">Ruby</a>, and <a href="http://www.piersharding.com/download/php/sapnwrfc/">PHP</a> too.</p>
