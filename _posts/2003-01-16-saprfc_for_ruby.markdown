SAP::Rfc for Ruby is the Ruby equivalent of the <a
href='http://search.cpan.org/author/PIERS/'>SAP::Rfc</a> for Perl.
This library binds the C rfc library provided by <a
href='http://www.sap.com'>SAP</a>, to Ruby to enable the
user to perform Remote Function Calls in a clean OO manner.
Comprehensive support is provided for translating all SAP data types in and
out of native Ruby data types, as well as SAP Data Dictionary structures.
There is full support for automatic discovery of RFC interface definitions, to
make the process of coding for RFC calls as simple as possible.
saprfc can be found at: <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/raa/list.rhtml?name=saprfc'>saprfc</a>.
