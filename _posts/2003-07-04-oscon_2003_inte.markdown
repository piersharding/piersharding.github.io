Well <a href='http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/'>DJ Adams</a> and I are back at
OSCON again.  This years joint presentation is about an old favourite of
ours - Integrating SAP R/3 with Open Source Software and Open Protocols.
<br/>
The talk will cover the main integration product suites of <a
href='http://www.sap.com'>SAP</a> (RFC, SAP
Business Connector, and the Web Application Suite aka Net Weaver), and how
Open Source, and Open Protocols can be used to engineer conduits in and
out of SAP.
<br/>
As usual, we have a live demo showing the different options for the
various supported protocols, across different Open Source programming
languages - so come along and have a laugh with/at us ;-).
<br/>

- our slot is on Wednesday the 9th of July, at 5:15 pm.
