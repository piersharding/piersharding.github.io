<h3>Auth SAML 2.0 for Mahara</h3>

<p>Following on from the SAML 2.0 work that I've done recently for Moodle, I thought it was useful to do the same for the <a href="http://www.mahara.org">Mahara</a> ePortfolio service, while I was in the same space.  Details of the first release can be found <a href="http://wiki.mahara.org/Plugins/Auth/Saml">here</a>, with tested version for both trunk, and 1.1_STABLE.</p>
