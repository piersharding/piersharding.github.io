<h3>Moodle Integration with SAP</h3>

<p>Over the last few months I have been working on developing the new SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK compatible PHP connector.  The main driver for this is to develop Moodle <-> SAP integration.  Finally, I have reached the first step towards that goal with developing mod/auth/sap.</p>

<p>This enables SAP authenticated logins, and the use of SAPs SSO via Logon Tickets.</p>

<p>The module is available at: <a href='http://www.piersharding.com/download/php/' target='blank'>http://www.piersharding.com/download/php/</a>.</p>
