<h3>OpenERP and Pentaho</h3>

<p>As part of some ongoing investigation work of the potential use of <a href="http://www.openerp.com">OpenERP</a>, I have had a look into connecting OpenERP with <a href="http://www.pentaho.org">Pentaho</a>.  At other times, I have implemented a limited form of Pentaho BI reporting for previous employers, but had mostly confined my activities to using the Metadata reporting object designer, which gives users the ability to create their own simple reports which they can generate as html, pdf, or spreadsheet.  This time, I wanted to get to grips with the far more powerful forms of interactive reporting, which meant <a href="http://mondrian.pentaho.org/">Mondrian</a>.</p>

<p>It's not easy getting it up and running (need to setup datasources, build Modrian schemas, design MDX queries, and then implement the xaction),  but once you are there, there is so much potential.  The ability to tune the queries interactively using the Pivot reporting engine, and the drill down features are excellent.</p>
