I've just completed a post on SAP SCN regarding using In-Memory column oriented database MonetDB with SAP and R for exploratory data analysis titled "<a href="http://scn.sap.com/community/scripting-languages/blog/2013/01/31/r-sap-and-opensource-in-memory-databases">Data Hackery - R, SAP, and OpenSource in-memory databases</a>" .

This uses an R library that I've created as a database interface to <a href="http://www.monetdb.org/">MonetDB</a> called <a href="https://github.com/piersharding/RMonet">RMonet</a>.
