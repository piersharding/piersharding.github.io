<h3>SAP::Rfc for Perl version 1.39 - finally UNICODE Support</h3>

SAP::Rfc 1.39 for Perl has finally been released - thanks both to John from IED and Bjoern Hippenstiel for their contributions, we now have UNICODE support.  I would be very interested to here back from people who are testing this, as it is quite a major step forward.  In particular - this will clear the way for customers with all double byte languages across Asia etc.

Download as usual from CPAN <a href='http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=SAP-Rfc'>here</a>
