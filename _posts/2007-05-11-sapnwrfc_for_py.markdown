The first version of sapnwrfc for Python is now available.  Like the sapnwrfc for Ruby, and Perl, this is a complete rewrite to take advantage of the new SAP NW RFCSDK, with unicode support, and support for deep structures.  This version provides Client side RFC support only.  The download is available <a href='http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/sapnwrfc/' target='_blank'>here</a>
