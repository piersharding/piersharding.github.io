<p>
SAP::Rfc for Ruby version 0.15 has a large number of changes.  These include:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Caching of interface, and structure discovery - whenever a call to SAP::Rfc#discover is made, a series of RFC calls are performed to look up what the definition of the interface is (same applies for SAP::Rfc#structure).  This can be a performance hit for a complex RFC interface, or situations where an RFC enabled script is fired frequently.  invoke SAP::Rfc.useCache = true to activate caching - see documentation for further details.
</li>
<li>Inorder to tidy up accessors for parameters, and structure components, some changes have been made.  The new syntax for setting parameter values is iface.PARM_NAME = value instead of iface.PARM_NAME.value = new_value.  The same applies to structure components where: str.FIELD_NAME = new_value as opposed to str.FIELD_NAME.value = new_value.</li>
</ul>
