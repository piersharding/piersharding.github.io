<p>I've just recently had contact from Lance, at the <a href='http://www.engineyard.com'>Engine Yard</a>, who specialise in Rails applicaition development, and Hosting.  These guys recognise that for their more Enterprise related clients, there is likely to be an <a href='http://www.sap.com'>SAP</a> related dimension to their requirements.</p>
<p>To me - this kind of interest shows that <a href='http://www.rubyonrails.com'>Ruby on Rails</a> is making a step change in it's progress through the world of IT, where it will likely start penetrating into the Enterprise software development market.
