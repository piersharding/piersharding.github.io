<p>
Olivier has done it again - Olivier is my generous win32 porter for Perl and SAP::Rfc, and now he has made SAP::Rfc for Ruby available too, as a gem package.
the Ruby gem is available for download from <a href='http://www.piersharding.com/download/ruby/saprfc-0.11-mswin32.gem'>here</a>.
<br/>
Remember - when you are using gems - instead of the 'require saprfc' to pull in the SAP::Rfc library you must use:
<pre class='code'>
require 'rubygems'
require_gem "saprfc"
rfc = SAP::Rfc.new(...)
...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This opens SAP::Rfc up to all those windows users who have contacted me over the last year.
</p>
<p>
Thanks Olivier!
