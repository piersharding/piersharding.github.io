<h3>saprfc for Python</h3>

From the README: saprfc for Python module is intended to facilitate
RFC calls to an SAP R/3 system of release 3.1x and above.  It may work for
earlier versions but it hasn't been tested.
The fundamental purpose of the production of this package, is to provide a
clean object oriented interface to RFC calls from within Python.  This will
hopefully have a number of effects:
(1) make it really easy to do RFC calls to SAP from Python in an object
oriented fashion (Doh!)
(2) promote Python as the interface/scripting/glue language of choice for
interaction with SAP R/3.
(3) make the combination of Linux, Apache, and Python the killer app for
internet connectivity with SAP.
(4) Establish a small fun open source project that people are more than
welcome to contribute to, if they so wish.
Comprehensive support is provided for translating all SAP data types in and
out of native Python data types, as well as SAP Data Dictionary structures.
There is full support for automatic discovery of RFC interface definitions, to
make the process of coding for RFC calls as simple as possible.
saprfc can be found at: <a href='http://www.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&name=saprfc&version=&summary=&description=&keywords=&_pypi_hidden=0'>saprfc</a>.
