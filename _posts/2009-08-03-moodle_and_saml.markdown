<p>Of late I have been doing a lot of SSO integration work for the NZ Ministry of Education, and during this time I came across an excellent project  <a href="http://rnd.feide.no/">FEIDE</a>.  One of the off shoots of this has been the development of a high quality PHP library for SAML 2.0 Web SSO -  <a href="http://rnd.feide.no/simplesamlphp">SimpleSAMLPHP</a>.</p>

<p>For Moodle integration, Erlend Str√∏msvik of Ny Media AS, developed an authentication plugin, which I've made a number of changes to around configuration options, and  <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a> session integration.  This has now been documented and added to Moodle Contrib to give it better visibility to the Moodle community at large.  Documentation is <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/AUTHSAML_authentication_plugin">here</a> and the contrib entry is <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=2574">here</a>.</p>
