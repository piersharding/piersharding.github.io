<h3>SAP::Rfc and saprfc UNICODE support for win32</h3>

<p>
Over the last few weeks I have been working with <a href='http://toolbox.boudry.org/'>Olivier</a> to work through the compiling issues to make UNICODE support for SAP::Rfc for Perl, and saprfc for Ruby available under win32.  These both require <a href='http://gettext.sourceforge.net/'>iconv</a> for the charset conversion, but you need not worry about that as they have been compiled for you as <a href='http://www.piersharding.com/download/win32/SAP-Rfc-1.52-unicode.zip'>PPD</a>, and <a href='http://www.piersharding.com/download/ruby/saprfc-0.31-mswin32-unicode.gem'>GEM</a> respecitvely.
