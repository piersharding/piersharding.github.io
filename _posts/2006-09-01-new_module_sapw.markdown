<p>Announcing my new Project SAP::WAS for Ruby.  This library enables SAP Web Services access encapsulated in the same manner as SAP::Rfc - abstracting away the complexities of dealing with SOAP packet encapsulation, and bringing the benefits of interface discovery.<br/><br />
The library can be found by following the directions <a href='http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sapwas'>here</a>.</p>
