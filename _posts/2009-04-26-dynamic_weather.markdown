<h3>Dynamic Weather Map</h3>

<p>I had once seen on a colleague of mines Mac, a weather widget of New Zealand, that gave him an animated view of the weather situation as seen by the satellite passing over.  I had not been able to find this animation on the <a href="http://www.metservice.co.nz">Met Service </a>  website, and was puzzling over where the data was coming from.  Then I realised it was staring me in the face in the <a href="http://www.metservice.co.nz/public/maps/tasman-sea-nz-infrared-series.html">Infrared series</a>. So - in a bit of retro shell script coding, using GET, perl, convert, and gifsicle, I built my own <a href="http://www.piersharding.com/download/weather_anim.gif"><img border="0" src="http://www.piersharding.com/download/weather_anim.gif"/></a>.</p>
