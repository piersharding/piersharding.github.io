<p>The first version of <a href='http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sap4rails' 
target='_blank'>sap4rails</a> has been released.  This has crystalised an idea of using <a href='http://www.rubyonrails.org' target='_blank'>Ruby on Rails</a> as a Framework for developing <a href='http://www.sap.com' target='_blank'>SAP</a> enabled web based applications.</p>
<p>The idea is to encapsulate SAP RFC calls from defined BAPIs so that Rails like data Models can be constructed.</p>
