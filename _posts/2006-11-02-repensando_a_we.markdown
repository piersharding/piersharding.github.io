<h3>Repensando a web com Rails</h3>

<a href='http://www.balanceonrails.com.br/'>Fabio Akita</a> has just contacted me to say that his new book <a href='http://www.brasport.com.br/index.php?Escolha=8&Livro=L00209'>"Repensando a web com Rails"</a> has been released for the Brazilian market.  The book is primarily about Ruby on Rails, but contains a section on SAP integration with Rails, which I helped (a little) with<br/>
Congratualtions Fabio - Hope it sells well.
