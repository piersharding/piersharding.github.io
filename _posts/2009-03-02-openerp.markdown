<h3>OpenERP</h3>

<p>As part of my job at <a href="http://www.Catalyst.net.nz">Catalyst</a> I've been part of a process of evaluating Open Source ERP systems.  The first one up is <a href="http://www.OpenERP.com">OpenERP</a>  and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised.  Having come from a long term SAP background, I'm appreciating the thought that has gone into usability, and intuitiveness of the user experience.  Also - big bonus - it's NOT written in Java, but Python!</p>

<p>Having just finished the Order to Cash cycle, and then followed it through on the Financial reporting. and cost account side, I'm finding that there is nothing missing that I would have expected to find from SAP - I'm excited, as I feel that OpenSource may have finally reached prime time in the ERP world.</p>

<p>Next up will be <a href="http://www.compiere.com">Compiere</a>, which will have to go a long way to win me over I think.</p>

<p>Note: on reflection, I should add that this is in the context of SMB.</p>
