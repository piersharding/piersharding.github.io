<p>This week I've burnt some midnight oil, to get some additional features into sapnwrfc for PHP.  These are most notably properly named exceptions thrown for connection, and RFC call issues, and activate/deactivate parameter control for RFC calls (very handy if you want to ignore bulky parameter values).</p>
